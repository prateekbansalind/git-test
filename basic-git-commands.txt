# To create a git repo in a working directory

steps: 
1. in bash: go to the working directory which you want it to be a part of git repo.
2. bash: type "git init" to initialize a git repo. It will be created as ".git" folder in the working directory. Its is a hidden file, which you can see with the command called "ls -a".
3. Now you have a git repo but nothing has been pushed and commited into.
4. use command "git status" - to see which are files are present in the staging area. "staging area" is a mediator place between working dir and local repo.
5. To add files from work dir to local repo - use command "git add <file name>" or for all files "git add ."
6. Once files are staged, then use this command to commit the changes with a message. - "git commit -m "<Message>"". (message should be in present tense)
7. To check whether the file has commited or not - use command "git log".

2. git branch -M main     : here the main is the name of the main branch
3. git push -u origin main     : here -u is used to merge and push the files from local to remote repo.
